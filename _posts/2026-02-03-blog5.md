Been a while since I wrote anything here, last year was really tough, but im here now

Things are looking up now at least. i got hired for a job in Seattle, so i can finally get out of this state. i'm so tired of Texas, and there are a lot of things i want to leave behind here

I kept up with learning bass too, im really happy with the progress i've made, and im starting to compose little pieces of songs

i'll try to keep posting here, it's more for my own sake anyway
