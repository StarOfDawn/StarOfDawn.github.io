Started ADHD meds only a few days ago, but it feels like it's already been a lifetime. Maybe it's more that it's been my whole life coming, and starting here, starting new, a new lifetime it begins.

Last week was hard, but it already feels like a distant dream, and ending it by starting new brings light to hope and hope to life.

I can write, I can draw, and I can do the things I wanted to for a long time.

Now see where I go.
