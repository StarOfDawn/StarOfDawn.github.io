Hi, I'm Dawn / Renata, and this is my website :3

It's still a work in progress but I hope after a bit over a month of on-and-off work, it's at least starting to be interesting. I like to draw, and I do more hands-on projects as well as code sometimes too. I'll try to keep this site updated with anything I'm working on.

Sorry for the plain design, I'm planning to add more fun stuff to the pages soon!
