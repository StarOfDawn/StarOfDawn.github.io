Hi, I'm Dawn :3 welcome to my website

It's still a work in progress, i edit pretty sporadically but i hope it's at least starting to be interesting. I like to play bass and draw, and I do hands-on projects as well as code sometimes too. I'll try to keep this site updated with anything I'm working on.

Sorry for the plain design, I'm planning to add more fun stuff to the page designs soon!
